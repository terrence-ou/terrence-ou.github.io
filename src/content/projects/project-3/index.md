This markdown editor, built with TypeScript, React, and Redux Toolkit, enables users to preview, edit, save, and delete markdown files. The interface also features switchable themes and a responsive layout (but it does not support mobile because the small screen is not ideal for markdown editing, previewing, and file managing that all happen together). The project also uses Tailwindcss and Headless UI for styling.
