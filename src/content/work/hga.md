- Worked with Three.js and 3D modeling team to create interfaces to display Architectural models in different scales;
- Implemented interactions using React to switch the model’s lighting setups and camera positions to optimize the app’s performance;
- Used D3.js to create LEED-evaluation-related data visualizations, for instance, scatter plot showing the predicted dynamics of the lab occupancy, force chart showing the building’s connectivity to the surrounding public transportation and facilities, heat map displaying the estimated energy consumption in a year.
